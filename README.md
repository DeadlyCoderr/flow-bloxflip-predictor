Bloxflip Predictor written in Batch

100% accuracy in mines, crash, etc. 

**HOW TO USE:**
1. Make sure your anti-virus is not deleting the file - this happens because your antivirus detects that our predictor is injecting into bloxflip (needed for the predictor). If it is, turn it off and then back on after running the file.

2. Wait for the prompt that says "Looking for Bloxflip instance" and then open the Bloxflip website. The predictor will automatically find your browser window and launch the GUI.

3. Select game mode in the predictor and run the same mode on the Bloxflip website.

4. Enjoy! 

- **NOTE:** DO *NOT* WIN OVER 10K ROBUX IN THE SAME DAY USING THIS. Bloxflip staff will check your win logs and catch on because of the high win rate / accuracy.

TODO:
- Use pypuppeteer or playwright instead of hiddenselenium which is outdated.
- Convert into a discord bot.
- Make predictions based on round ids instead of injecting into browser.
- Implement support for MacOS and Linux.
- Change color scheme based on system color settings. (DONE)
